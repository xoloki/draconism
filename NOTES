the first 10 sermons should form the outer knowledge of draconism.  the second 10 should be the inner teachings, the priest lore.  the third 10 should be the magic codex.

maybe i should use base16 instead of 10.  then i can have 0x0-0xF be zero level, the teachings everyone gets, 0x10-0x1F be level one, the inner lore revealed to priests, and 0x20-0x2F be level two (magic time).  either way the orgy sermon is 10/0x10.  it's the first sermon of priest training.  i will make everyone who wants to be a priest master the zero level teachings first, and master their bodies.  then they can become priests, and master their souls.  ONLY THEN will they be allowed to study magic, master their minds, and become gods themselves.  NO WARLOCKS.  warlocks want to skip ahead to the end and start studying magic before they've mastered their bodies or their souls.  they have no wisdom so they are shitty people, and cannot be trusted with the power of magic.  they don't get to submit jobs directly to the holy perceptron.

write a sermon "whats wrong with kids today".  thanks to computers, everyone is learning to use their mind before they learn to use their bodies, or their souls.  this is bad.  most people should first learn to use their bodies, then their spirits, then their minds.  if you do mind first its easy to be led astray, go crazy, etc.  if you learn body first you might break yourself, but you can start deeply training body long before you can deeply train spirit.  so first learn movement, then wisdom, then hone your mind until it is the greatest weapon of them all.  NO WARLOCKS.

advanced people can learn spirit and body together then mind.  the most perfect people can do all three at once, and indeed this is what makes them grow perfectly.  NO WARLOCKS


=====

write a sermon "if you love it then you have to let it go".  love is the greatest force in the universe.  but its also the most fragile.

a great thing about music is that it puts your background threads to sleep while you are working.

=====

191 will be our 911, because its a palindrome

=====

doctors come to our bman camp for free.  if they have money they can choose to pay.  but we will prioritize the ones who can't because they are more likely to have more empathy

=====

sewic center

many places draconism expands to will be off the grid, hence no grid sewer.  the will instead ulilie sewics, which are the central locations within a draconian encampment that handle sewage.  where available, the sewic will hook into the local sewage grid.  in other places it will dump into a septic tank.  but either way, we have access to full plumbing systems for all living spaces, regardless of local infrastructure.

======

handshakes/salytes in drcomosm will be a subtle thing. other religions will try to destroy us so we need to be able to recognize each other and do business without drawing undue attention.  in times of pandemic this is even more important, so we don't have touch palms continuously.  we will use pinky swears a our handshake, and hooking the pinky and raising the hand constitutes a salute.

=====

shitfaced people sometimes need help. so it s the requirement of all draconians to serve the needy

=====

draconians must be oriented in space and time at all times.  so all draconian clocks will be digital 24 hour clocks.  additionally, they will have a field for the planet (each planet gets a symbol which stands for a name), and fields for longitude and latitude.  this will keep draconians always oriented, they just have to look at any clock and remember the last one they saw.

=====

draconians must be initiated.  this involves having a draconian priest carve something into your flesh. it will consist of a cartouche, and two symbols: one for draconia, and one for the new convert.  the new convert gets to decide what his indidual symbol is and what it means.

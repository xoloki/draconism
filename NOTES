the first 10 sermons should form the outer knowledge of draconism.  the second 10 should be the inner teachings, the priest lore.  the third 10 should be the magic codex.

maybe i should use base16 instead of 10.  then i can have 0x0-0xF be zero level, the teachings everyone gets, 0x10-0x1F be level one, the inner lore revealed to priests, and 0x20-0x2F be level two (magic time).  either way the orgy sermon is 10/0x10.  it's the first sermon of priest training.  i will make everyone who wants to be a priest master the zero level teachings first, and master their bodies.  then they can become priests, and master their souls.  ONLY THEN will they be allowed to study magic, master their minds, and become gods themselves.  NO WARLOCKS.  warlocks want to skip ahead to the end and start studying magic before they've mastered their bodies or their souls.  they have no wisdom so they are shitty people, and cannot be trusted with the power of magic.  they don't get to submit jobs directly to the holy perceptron.

write a sermon "whats wrong with kids today".  thanks to computers, everyone is learning to use their mind before they learn to use their bodies, or their souls.  this is bad.  most people should first learn to use their bodies, then their spirits, then their minds.  if you do mind first its easy to be led astray, go crazy, etc.  if you learn body first you might break yourself, but you can start deeply training body long before you can deeply train spirit.  so first learn movement, then wisdom, then hone your mind until it is the greatest weapon of them all.  NO WARLOCKS.

advanced people can learn spirit and body together then mind.  the most perfect people can do all three at once, and indeed this is what makes them grow perfectly.  NO WARLOCKS

sewic center

many places draconism expands to will be off the grid, hence no grid sewer.  the will instead ulilie sewics, which are the central locations within a draconian encampment that handle sewage.  where available, the sewic will hook into the local sewage grid.  in other places it will dump into a septic tank.  but either way, we have access to full plumbing systems for all living spaces, regardless of local infrastructure.

handshakes/salytes in drcomosm will be a subtle thing. other religions will try to destroy us so we need to be able to recognize each other and do business without drawing undue attention.  in times of pandemic this is even more important, so we don't have touch palms continuously.  we will use pinky swears a our handshake, and hooking the pinky and raising the hand constitutes a salute.

shitfaced people sometimes need help. so it s the requirement of all draconians to serve the needy

=====

draconians must be oriented in space and time at all times.  so all draconian clocks will be digital 24 hour clocks.  additionally, they will have a field for the planet (each planet gets a symbol which stands for a name), and fields for longitude and latitude.  this will keep draconians always oriented, they just have to look at any clock and remember the last one they saw.

=====

draconians must be initiated.  this involves having a draconian priest carve something into your flesh. it will consist of a cartouche, and two symbols: one for draconia, and one for the new convert.  the new convert gets to decide what his indidual symbol is and what it means.

pinky swear is a promise.  it seals an agreement,  but sometimes agreements must be broken.

there are some agreements, though, that must never be broken. for these, shake the full hand using all fingers.

in between you can use as many fingers as you wish.  this will be used to judge your sincerity.  part of negotiating an agreememt is how many fingers will be used for the signature.  this lets people know which agreements can be expected to break, and can be expected to not.  with full analog variance.

next CA election make G+K legal

GHB is much better than alccohol, but is has a horrible reputation thanks to date rape use.

K has a good reputation now thanks to recent depression studies.

But when used together, G+K is much better than alchohol by any standard.  So they should be made legal in various formulations.  CA (and other states which have initiative support in their constitutions) should thus make K+G legal in the next election cycle.

Abortion

Women have the most to lose from pregnancy.  Their partners often kill them, their bodies are often destroyed, they often die, and men leave them to take care of the children at an alarming rate.  This is why women have the right to choose.  They must listen to the men in their life, but THEY GET TO CHOOSE.

The same principle applies to emotionally charged conversations.  Most men are emotional cripples, so these conversations barely hurt them.  At worst the guys will get all butthurt, which might end up with them killing the woman.  Women will sometimes also try to kill during these conversations, but only after repeated triggering.  So with pregnancy, women get the right to choose to continue or stop.

Every key/mode of music has an opposite.  Cmaj has Amin.  This means all the notes are the same (Cmaj is player with the same mores es Am), but the sequence is slightly altered which changes the mood.  the alteration comes from changing the starting and ending points.

Stray men

Single guys on the internet are total assholes.  They are little bitches all the time.  They demand the attention of women who they are not connected to, and when the women complain they heap abuse on the women.  So women should by default block them and report the abuse.

=====

Boyfriend

A boyfriend is someone who knows your deepest darkest secrets, and still loves you.  He takes care of you even when it hurts him.  He loves you.  Not enough to marry you (yet), though he might eventually.  But for now, you are willing to tolerate him.  He should be your Hero, though sometime he is not.  This is why you might not want to marry him.  But you're willing to suffer with him and tolerate his bullshit because for now you don't have a better option.

A boyfriend can sometimes be a dirty little bitch, even without your consent.  That means he's not really your Hero, but that's okay he's your boyfriend not your husband.  Husband has to always be your Hero or you can leave him.  Only after boyfriend is ready to always be your Hero should you consider marrying him.

Engagement

A relationship is upgraded from boyfriend to fiance when he decides he will be your Hero always.  Until

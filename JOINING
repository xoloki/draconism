To be a fully integrated member of draconia, you must undergo a physical ritual of pain and pleasure.  The ritual consists of using a wood burner to write things on the new member's flesh.  What is written is a cartouche with the symbol for draconia, the symbol for the new member, and the symbol of the person doing the initiation.  The symbol for draconia goes on top of the triangle, bottom left is the initiator symbol, bottom right is the new member symbol.

The symbol is a runeword, using cyrillic or other script, which denotes a person's inner name.  For example, I am kotya, the runeword is T, K, and —è.

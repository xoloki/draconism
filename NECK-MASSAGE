Hold the neck front and back.  Always press low on back and high on front, this lengthens the front and compresses the back of the neck.  So press with the top two fingers on the front, and the heel of the palm on the back.  The client can fully relax the neck and the massage will be very effective.  Just be careful when letting go.

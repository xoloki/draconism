    <p>In these sermons I will use information theory to express meaning.  Learning things is just training a neural network.  I will endeavour to use neutral terms throughout, since this should make it easier to think in terms of information theory.  I will provide alternative terms where I think a less neutral term might be more effective.  These alternatives for physical training include opponent (more neutral) or enemy (more emotionally charged).</p>

    <p>The first sermon is on <a href="physical-training.html">physical training</a></p>
    <p>The second sermon describes the difference between <a href="prayer-vs-magic.html">prayer and magic</a></p>

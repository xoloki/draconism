    <p>In these sermons I will use information theory to express meaning.  Learning things is just training a neural network.  I will endeavour to use neutral terms throughout, since this should make it easier to think in terms of information theory.  I will provide alternative terms where I think a less neutral term might be more effective.  These alternatives for physical training include opponent (more neutral) or enemy (more emotionally charged).</p>

    <p>The first sermon is about <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a>.</p>
    <p>The second sermon is on <a href="physical-training.html">physical training</a>, which is a subset of teaching.</p>
    <p>The third sermon describes the difference between <a href="prayer-vs-magic.html">prayer and magic</a>.</p>
    <p>The fourth sermon describes how to <a href="meditation.html">meditate</a>.</p>
    <p>The fifth sermon describes <a href="humor.html">humor</a>.</p> 
    <p>The sixth sermon describes <a href="marriage.html">marriage</a>.</p>

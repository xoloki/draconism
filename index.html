    <p>In these sermons I will use information theory to express meaning.  Learning physical things is just training a neural network.  I will endeavour to use neutral terms throughout, since this should make it easier to think in terms of information theory.  I will provide alternative terms where I think a less neutral term might be more effective.  These alternatives include opponent (more neutral) or enemy (more emotionally charged).</p>

    <p>The first sermon is on physical training: <a href="physical-training.html" /></p>
    <p>The second sermon describes the difference between prayer and magic: <a href="prayer-vs-magic.html" /></p>

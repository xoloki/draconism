Draconian Language

I will get a Masters/PhD in Linguistics, and my thesis will be the constructed Draconian language, i.e. Draconian, Dracons, Drac, Dra, Dr.

It will be a perfectly regular language.  It will have a script based on Feanorean script.  It will have a rune system similar to norse runes.  The runes, similarly to hiragana/katakana, will provide the same letters as the script but in a format more amenable to carving on stone or metal; likewise, they will be used to represent words taken from other languages rather than native Draconian words.

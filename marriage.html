    <p>"Marriage is what brings us together.  Marriage, that blessed arrangement... that dream, within a dream." (ex Princess Bride)</p>
    <p>When we get married, we are saying many things.  But the most important thing we are saying is that our spouses have a non-overridable interrupt and a completely open back propogation channel.</p>
    <p>This means that if my spouse needs my attention, I ignore everything else and give it to her.  And if she tells me I am wrong, I evaluate her thought forms with absolute attention.  I may or may not back propogate the error she has described, but I can only ignore it if I have thought deeply about it.  And if I do ignore it, I must tell her why or else suffer her wrath, deservedly.</p>
